    <h2>The tale of Herbet Gruel</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my story. I am a slight whisp of a man, slender and fragile,
      features wrinkled and worn, eyes sunken into their sockets like rabbits
      cowering in their burrows. The <em>years have not been kind to me</em>,
      but yet I hold no regrets, as I have overcome all that sought to ail me,
      and have been allowed to bide my time, making mischief as I travel to and
      fro, 'cross the unyielding landscape of the
      <a href="http://outer-rim-rocks.co.uk">outer rim</a>.

    <h3>Buster</h3>
    <p>
      Buster is my guardian angel. Before that, he was my dog. Before that, who
      knows? I lost my dog many moons ago while out hunting geese in the
      undergrowth. A shot rang out from my rifle, and I called for Buster to
      collect the goose I had felled. He ran off towards where the bird had
      landed, but never returned. I never found his body, but I comfort myself
      with the thought that he did not die; rather he transcended to a higher
      place, and now watches over me, to ensure my well-being.

    <h3>My possessions</h3>
    <p>A travelling man needs very little to accompany him on the road:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My hat full of memories</li>
      <li>My trusty walking cane</li>
      <li>A purse that did contain gold at one time</li>
      <li>A diary, from the year 1874</li>
      <li>An empty glasses case</li>
      <li>A newspaper, for when I need to look busy</li>
    </ul>
